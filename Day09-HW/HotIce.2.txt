skippy62able: LA' Be'ast he're and toda'y I'm go'nna hit so'me thi'ngs on the sci'ence on yo'ur... So'rry abo'ut that, I hit my he'ad. E'arly be'ast here toda'y I've 
be'en inspi'red by fe'llow youtu'ber Nurd Ra'ge. Thro'ugh his sci'ence tuto'rials I've le'arned how to ma'ke hot ice and what I'm go'ing to do toda'y is fi'nd o'ut 
if this i'ce is hot or cold! Now for tho'se of you' don't know hot i'ce is a'lso known as so'dium a'cetate trihydra'te. And when you' bo'il it down i'nto a li'quid, 
co'ol it off and then to'uch it, it instantly fre'ezes. Now, in o'rder to make hot i'ce, all yo'u ha've to do is mix so'me vi'negar, some ba'king so'da, bo'il it 
down into a li'quid and pre'sto cha'nge-o, you ha've so'me hot i'ce! But as you can cle'arly se'e, I comple'tely fu'cked it up beca'use I don't jack shi't abo'ut 
sci'ence. So what I had to do was go onli'ne and for a la'rge sum of mo'ney purcha'sed 10 po'unds of pre'-made so'dium a'cetate trihydra'te. I had to bo'il that 
down into a li'quid, add some wa'ter. Ma'ke a mo've! I ha've a gi'ant bo'at lo'ad of hot i'ce in the fre'ezer co'oling off and in fi've mi'nutes I'm go'ing to be 
sti'cking my enti're ha'nd i'nto that ja'r so sta'y tu'ned! Witho'ut fu'rther a'do, I am the LA' be'ast and I'm abo'ut to pe'rsonally find o'ut whe'ther or no't hot i'ce 
is ho't or co'ld by sti'cking my enti're ha'nd i'nto this gi'ant ja'r of so'dium a'cetate trihydra'te! Ha've a go'od day! Oh my Go'd! A'aah, it's stu'ck! Oh Go'd! Oh 
Go'd! Oh my ha'nd! Get it o'ff! I ma'de it bu'rn up! Fu'ck! 


Оператор: A're you' alri'ght? 


skippy62able: Oka'y! Fu'cking he'll.. Oka'y. Oka'y. Oka'y, well, I went to he're as you ca're. I told the do'ctor what wo'uld ha'ppen. He had absolu'tely 
no' sy'mpathy for me'. He put some burn gels and lidoca'ine. I think on my hand. You wra'pped it up and sent me on my way... uhm... For some re'ason I was 
overrea'cting, but when I put my ha'nd into that hot i'ce, it felt li'ke I put my hand di'rectly onto a sca'lding hot burning sto've... I don't know what 
Nu'rd Ra'ge did di'fferently, but I think I scre'wed mi'ne up... Ple'ase, ki'ds, whate'ver you do, do not ever try this at home! And reme'mber: o'nly you' can 
preve'nt fo'rest fi'res! Ha've a go'od day! That was stu'pid.

Я: "За'мёрзла" рука'...


Игорь: Мо'жет, это ожо'г наоборо'т? 


Я: Ну так что'?
